                    <p>Hello, I’m Joseph Kimbrough! Welcome to my website where I keep a collection of projects, interests, and upcoming developments that I’m working on. I’m currently on the hunt for a software engineer positon, while also developing my skills in C# and other programming languages/concepts in the mean time. On this page you will get to know a little bit about myself, along with some of my core values that I strive to achieve.

                    </p>
                    <p>My name is Joseph Kimbrough, I'm an aspiring software engineer trying to make an impact on the world that will long surpass me. I thrive in the unknown and love a great challenge. Pushing the limits of one self's and settling for nothing less than exceptional are values that I believe every software engineer should try to accomplish. Creation is a beautiful thing, if done right, that is why preparation and execution are things I focus the most on. If you would like to chat more and get to know how I would be beneficial to your team, please refer to my contact information above.</p>
