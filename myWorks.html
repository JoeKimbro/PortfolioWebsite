                <p>My name is Joseph Kimbrough, I'm an aspiring software engineer trying to make an impact on the world that will long surpass me. I thrive in the unknown and love a great challenge. Pushing the limits of one self's and settling for nothing less than exceptional are values that I believe every software engineer should try to accomplish. Creation is a beautiful thing, if done right, that is why preparation and execution are things I focus the most on. If you would like to chat more and get to know how I would be beneficial to your team, please refer to my contact information above.</p>
